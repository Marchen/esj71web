# Childcare Fee Assistance

## Childcare fee subsidy for conference participants of ESJ71

The 71th Annual Meeting of the Ecological Society of Japan (ESJ71) in Yokohama will be held as a hybrid of on-site and online. As with last year, we will provide childcare support for conference participants through childcare fee subsidies.
We will support part of the childcare fees when the participants use service (a sitter, temporary childcare at a nursery school, etc.) in the area of their residence or of the event venue (Yokohama City and surrounding areas). We are pleased to inform you that the advanced application has started. It is necessary to apply in advance and submit a receipt for childcare fees as follows.

## Applicant

All conference participants of ESJ71 (You can use this support regardless of weekdays or weekends, even if you are not a presenter.)
If you are not an ESJ member but are invited to a symposium or forum as a presenter or commentator, you can get this support.

## Applicable period

Childcare fees from March 16th (Saturday) to March 21st (Thursday) 2024.

## Subsidy amount

We subsidize half of the cost, while the maximum per child per day is 5,000 yen. If you are also receiving a childcare subsidy from other organizations such as your affiliated institution, we will pay half the amount of the childcare fee after deducting the subsidy from the other organizations. There is no limit to the number of children. If the requested amount exceeds the budget, the subsidy amount per person may be reduced.

## Application (in advance only)

The application will be accepted from January 17th (Wednesday) to 23:59 on February 20th (Tuesday) 2024. Please apply using [this application form](https://forms.gle/mscwZxBbaBgwg6LUA). Please note that you will not be able to receive a childcare subsidy without the advanced application.
We will send you e-mail for confirmation when we receive your application. If you do not receive a reply by the end of February, please contact the ESJ71 childcare staffs ([nursery@esj.ne.jp](mailto:nursery@esj.ne.jp)).

## Submission of receipt

After the ESJ71 conference, please prepare a receipt with usage details of childcare services (name, date, time, number of children). And then, please send the receipt image and your transfer account information by e-mail to [nursery@esj.ne.jp](mailto:nursery@esj.ne.jp) by 23:59 on March 28th (Thursday) 2024. Due to procedural difficulties, we will only accept accounts in Japan.
