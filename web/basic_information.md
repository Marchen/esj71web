## FORMAT OF THE MEETING

* The meeting will be held "online" (March 16 and 17) and "hybrid" (onsite + online, March 18–21).

* On March 16 and 17, All presentations except poster will be conducted using [Zoom meetings](https://zoom.us/jp-jp/meetings.html).Oral presentations require the file upload of pre-recorded lecture videos. The uploaded lecture videos will be made available on ONLINE CONF as well as streamed via Zoom at the time of presentation. Zoom will allow presenters to conduct a live Q&A session after the lecture videos have finished playing.
* Poster presentations on March 16 and 17 will be conducted using poster files uploaded to the platform (ONLINE CONF), which participants will be free to browse during ESJ71. During core time, presenters can use video conferencing to explain their poster and answer questions to the audience.
* Presentations on March 18-21 will be given at the venue (Yokohama National University) and simultaneously streamed in real time via zoom. Those who have made online poster presentations (including high school students' posters) may also display their posters at the venue on March 19 and 20, if they wish.
* All talks, with the exception of “Oral presentations”, will be recorded and made accessible to participants on the platform until about one month after the ESJ71 meeting (on-demand streaming). The availability of the recordings will be confirmed to the presenter at registration.

## FACILITATING INTERACTION AMONG PARTICIPANTS

Of course, you may also be able to make other social interactions outside the sessions you have attended. To make ESJ71 a productive meeting, we welcome your active participation.

### Handling of research achievements when presentations cannot be given at ESJ71

For applicants who have registered abstracts of presentations and paid the registration fee by the deadline, ESJ will approve the presentation information and abstracts as achievements, even if presentations cannot be given due to the following reasons:

* Failures of the meeting platform or large networks.
If an applicant does not pay the registration fee by the deadline, their presentation information and abstract will be deleted from the ESJ71 abstract webpage and the presentation will not be approved as an academic achievement.

### Display of Career Explorer images

If a student/postdoc speaker wishes, they can display a Career Explorer (CE) image indicating that they are looking for a job at the time of the oral or poster presentations. Please download the image from [The Japan Society of Applied Physics website](https://www.jsap.or.jp/jsap-meeting/career-explorer) and display it near the title page of the oral presentations or the title of the posters.
