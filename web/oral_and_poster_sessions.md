# Oral and poster presentation sessions

## Application for oral and poster sessions

* ESJ members are invited to give a presentation during either oral or poster sessions. Please see the description below for details of each presentation type. Applicants can choose the preferred presentation type (oral or poster) at the time of application; however, due to limitations in the number of system accounts and time, we might ask you to change your presentation type.
* For ESJ71, we decided to limit the number of applications for the Poster Presentation Award to 500 to ensure enough judges. The number of general poster presentations is not limited.
* Up to 270 applicants for online posters may also present their posters on-site; if there are more than 270 applicants, priority will be given to students, and the missing applicants will be selected by lottery.
* Oral presentations consist of sessions in both Japanese and English. The sessions in English include presentations entered for the English Presentation Award. Oral presentations can be given in English during Japanese oral sessions.
* We also encourage speakers in Japanese to include English along with Japanese, even if only in some parts of their presentation files, to improve scientific communication with participants who are less proficient in Japanese.
* Applicants will be asked to select preferred sections for their presentation at the time of registration. A list of available sections (see below) will be shown on the application form. Please select up to three. Please note that depending on the number of the applications, some sections may be combined or eliminated.
    * Sociality, cognitive ecology (ER Symposium 1)
    * Ecology and human culture (ER Symposium 2)
    * Plant communities
    * Plant populations
    * Plant reproduction
    * Plant ecophysiology
    * Life history of plants
    * Microbial ecology
    * Landscape ecology
    * Succession and regeneration
    * Animal–plant interactions
    * Evolution
    * Biodiversity
    * Mathematical ecology
    * Animal communities
    * Animal reproduction
    * Animal populations
    * Life history of animals
    * Behavior
    * Conservation
    * Ecosystem management
    * Invasive species
    * Material cycling
    * Education and popularization of ecology

### Notes

* Speakers (i.e., the main presenter at oral or poster presentations) must be ESJ members (co-authors do not need to be ESJ members).
* Speakers should register their presentations by 31st October 2023, and complete payment via the online registration system.
* Speakers should provide the presentation title (within 40 characters in Japanese, within 150 characters in English) and author names when applying for a presentation.
* Speakers should submit an abstract (within 800 characters in Japanese, within 400 words in English) via the online registration system by 31st January 2023.
* Each ESJ member is allowed to serve as the speaker for only one oral or poster presentation (but can co-present more than one).
* Organizers and speakers of symposia cannot give oral and poster presentations.
* Panels used for on-site poster display are A0 vertical. On-site speakers are free to use this space.
* If you choose the ER Symposia "Sociality, cognitive ecology" and "Ecology and human culture" and wish to present on-site, the display location for your poster will be arranged near the symposium venue.

## English Presentation Award

For ESJ71, the 10th English Presentation Award (EPA) will be held. We look forward to your applications. We also welcome oral presentations in English by mid-career/senior researchers who are not eligible for the award.

### Purpose of the Award

The English Presentation Award (EPA) aims to promote English presentations at the ESJ annual meetings and to offer all participants more opportunities to interact with international students and visiting researchers in Japan. The EPA sessions are also meant for students and early career researchers to improve their scientific communication skills, which are particularly useful in international meetings. The EPA in ESJ71 takes over these missions and intentions. The EPA is not a competition for language skills such as English fluency. Rather, the applicants are meant to compete in the research contents and the skills and attitudes about presenting their work. The winners are selected by the EPA working group in each section.

### Eligibility criteria

The previous EPA eligibility will also be followed in ESJ71. Namely, eligibility is limited to ESJ members who are undergraduate or graduate students or early-career researchers who have received a Ph.D. degree within 5 years, as of March 2024. Time taken off work for parental leave or family leave is not included in this 5-year limitation. Past winners of the Best EPA award are not eligible to apply, but past winners of the Excellent EPA award are eligible to apply. Please note that the eligibility criteria may be revised for ESJ72.

### Judging criteria

In each category, the winners are selected based on scoring by the judges. Details will be announced on the official ESJ71 website. Participants will be able to apply for the EPA through our online registration system. The system is expected to open around the early of October. Please visit our official ESJ71 website for the latest information. The EPA team group is looking forward to receiving your application.

## Poster Award

ESJ71 will give awards to outstanding poster presentations to encourage the research activities of early career researchers. Details about poster presentations will be posted on the ESJ71 official website too, so please refer to it when preparing posters. From the perspective of securing reviewers, ESJ71 set a limit of 500 applications for the Poster Award. Applications will be made on a “first- come, first-served” basis, and if the limit is reached, we will ask applicants to have presentations in general sessions (both oral and poster presentations) instead. There is no limit to the number of applications for the poster presentation session.

### Eligibility criteria

* Student ESJ members who have not obtained a Ph.D. as of the registration deadline for general sessions (31st October 2023).
* Those who have won the poster "Best Award" or "Excellence Award" in poster sessions of past ESJ meetings cannot apply even if they meet the above condition. Past ESJ meetings include ones held jointly with EAFES.
* In order to facilitate efficient judging, applicants for the Poster Award are required to submit a graphical abstract and explanatory video in addition to the poster itself as presentation content. However, the content of the graphical abstract and explanatory video will not affect the judging process.
* Those who have preferred the ER Symposia "Sociality, cognitive ecology" and "Ecology and human culture" for their presentation cannot apply to the poster award.

### Judging criteria

Poster Award applicants are requested to consider following points when preparing posters.

#### Transmission ability of poster information

In poster presentations, it is important that the research content is displayed in an easy-to-understand manner. For example, it is necessary to provide the following: (1) a good title, (2) an easy-to-understand abstract, (3) ingenuities to attract lines of sight, and (4) ingenuities to convey rough contents in a short time. For that purpose, it is important that the characters and figures/tables are easy to read, that there is not too much information, and that the main points can be understood without explanations. For the sake of fairness, please refrain from changing the title after registration.

#### Quality of research

Judges will consider the following points: (1) novelty and originality, (2) quality and quantity of data, (3) validity of analyses and methods, and (4) validity of discussion and conclusion.

### Notes

* For these online poster presentations, it is possible to upload the poster itself plus supplementary materials (PDF and/or video). However, only the online poster itself will be judged (even if a poster is presented also on-site). It is recommended to prepare the online poster in the format of A4 landscape × 4. Please note that the format of the poster is under discussion and we will keep you posted.
* The presentation technique (e.g., the skills shown by the presenter when explaining their poster) was subject to evaluation in the past, but it will not be considered at this meeting. This is because a good poster is thought to be understood just by reading it. Another reason is that the workload for the reviewers is significantly decreased by this. However, for posters that are difficult to evaluate just by looking at the poster, the reviewers may ask questions using the text chat or video-conferencing function during core time, and evaluate the poster based on the presenters’ responses.
* Consideration of researchers who do not fluently understand Japanese is also taken into account. During evaluation, only the contents of the poster will be evaluated regardless of the language used, but for posters that receive the same score following evaluation, the one that can be understood in English will be ranked higher. A poster that can be understood in English is one in which the title, introduction, and conclusion are written in English in addition to Japanese, so that the outline of the research can be understood just by reading the English parts. Alternatively, presenters may choose to provide a poster translated into English (English version poster) on a separate page.
* If you select "English" or "Bilingual" as the language used, please include explanations in English on the poster, or prepare a poster which is translated into English (English version poster).
